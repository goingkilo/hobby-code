1. scheme editor/ ide ( java, clojure  )
2. piano playing program. it's not very good yet (java,swing,processing)
3. i ching - hexagram generator - ( javascript canvas )
4. 3d display of information (java, processing )
5. 'naive bayes classifier' (java. downloads from the net, stores locally etc )
6. some dabblings in clojure and jython . they all work (for a _small_ value of 'work')


- edi and scythe are almost repeats. edi.clj too
- scythe needs sisc scheme to work, and a file location
- robot musician can use GAs ,maybe
- at some point in the future, we can connect the robotmusician to a pulse detector. bio feedback !!
- reddit needs a lot of attention. redditspace begs creating 
- 3d data in processing.js seems like a good idea
- 

- one day I'll have a website that accepts cash
